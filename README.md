# jsonplaceholder-client

Client program for [Dummy REST API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) using React & Redux based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Structure

```
jsonplaceholder-client/
  config/
  node_modules/
  scripts/
  src/
  .gitignore
  favicon.ico
  index.html
  package.json
  README.md
```

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `index.html` is the page template;
* `favicon.ico` is the icon you see in the browser tab;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.

You can **delete** or **rename** the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside `src`. For faster rebuilds, only files inside `src` are processed by Webpack.  
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, or Webpack won’t see them.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.  
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.

>**Known Issue:**
>
>You may encounter an issue where changing a file inside `src` doesn’t trigger a recompilation. Most likely this happens because the path in your filesystem differs in its casing from the path you imported. For example, if a file is called `App.js` but you are importing `app.js`, the watcher might not recognize changes to it. We are [considering](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/240) enforcing some checks to prevent this. If this doesn’t help, check out the page on [troubleshooting watching](https://webpack.github.io/docs/troubleshooting.html#watching).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:client`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run start:json-server`
Runs the json-server using local db using `./data.json` as seed data
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.  

> **Prerequisites**  
Install json-server in globally with `npm install -g json-server`  
Seed data can be downloaded using following commands at project top-level directory.
```
# using wget
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder/master/data.json
# using curl
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/typicode/jsonplaceholder/master/data.json >> data.json
```

### `npm start`
Runs both `npm run start:client` and `npm run start:json-server` simultaneously

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## How To...

### Add Images and Fonts

With Webpack, using static assets like images and fonts works similarly to CSS.

You can **`import` an image right in a JavaScript module**. This tells Webpack to include that image in the bundle. Unlike CSS imports, importing an image or a font gives you a string value. This value is the final image path you can reference in your code.

Here is an example:

```js
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.png'; // Tell Webpack this JS file uses this image

console.log(logo); // /logo.84287d09.png

function Header() {
  // Import result is the URL of your image
  return <img src={logo} alt="Logo" />;
}

export default function Header;
```

This works in CSS too:

```css
.Logo {
  background-image: url(./logo.png);
}
```

Webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with `./`) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, just like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by Webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, Webpack will give it a different name in production so you don’t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of Webpack.

**It is not required for React** but many people enjoy it (and React Native uses a similar mechanism for images). However it may not be portable to some other environments, such as Node.js and Browserify. If you prefer to reference static assets in a more traditional way outside the module system, please let us know [in this issue](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/28), and we will consider support for this.

### Display Lint Output in the Editor

>Note: this feature is available with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher.

Some editors, including Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, provide plugins for ESLint.

They are not required for linting. You should still the linter output right in your terminal as well as the browser console. However, if you prefer the lint results to appear right in your editor, there are some extra steps you can do.

You would need to install an ESLint plugin for your editor first.  
Then make sure `package.json` of your project ends with this block:

```js
{
  // ...
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "./node_modules/react-scripts/config/eslint.js"
  }
}
```

Projects generated with `react-scripts@0.2.0` and higher should already have it.  
If you don’t need ESLint integration with your editor, you can safely delete those three lines from your `package.json`.

Finally, you will need to install some packages *globally*:

```sh
npm install -g eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-flowtype
```

We recognize that this is suboptimal, but it is currently required due to the way we hide the ESLint dependency. The ESLint team is already [working on a solution to this](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/3458) so this may become unnecessary in a couple of months.

### Add Flow

Flow typing is currently [not supported out of the box](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/issues/72) with the default `.flowconfig` generated by Flow. If you run it, you might get errors like this:

```
node_modules/fbjs/lib/Deferred.js.flow:60
 60:     Promise.prototype.done.apply(this._promise, arguments);
                           ^^^^ property `done`. Property not found in
495: declare class Promise<+R> {
     ^ Promise. See lib: /private/tmp/flow/flowlib_34952d31/core.js:495

node_modules/fbjs/lib/shallowEqual.js.flow:29
 29:     return x !== 0 || 1 / (x: $FlowIssue) === 1 / (y: $FlowIssue);
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^ identifier `$FlowIssue`. Could not resolve name

src/App.js:3
  3: import logo from './logo.svg';
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./logo.svg. Required module not found

src/App.js:4
  4: import './App.css';
            ^^^^^^^^^^^ ./App.css. Required module not found

src/index.js:5
  5: import './index.css';
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ./index.css. Required module not found
```

To fix this, change your `.flowconfig` to look like this:

```
[libs]
./node_modules/fbjs/flow/lib

[options]
esproposal.class_static_fields=enable
esproposal.class_instance_fields=enable

module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.css$' -> 'react-scripts/config/flow/css'
module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.\(jpg\|png\|gif\|eot\|svg\|ttf\|woff\|woff2\|mp4\|webm\)$' -> 'react-scripts/config/flow/file'

suppress_type=$FlowIssue
suppress_type=$FlowFixMe
```

Re-run flow, and you shouldn’t get any extra issues.

If you later `eject`, you’ll need to replace `react-scripts` references with the `<PROJECT_ROOT>` placeholder, for example:

```
module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.css$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/config/flow/css'
module.name_mapper='^\(.*\)\.\(jpg\|png\|gif\|eot\|svg\|ttf\|woff\|woff2\|mp4\|webm\)$' -> '<PROJECT_ROOT>/config/flow/file'
```

We will consider integrating more tightly with Flow in the future so that you don’t have to do this.
